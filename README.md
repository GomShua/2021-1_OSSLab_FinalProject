# Sentiment Analyzing
## What does this project do?
This project is python based web service application that allows users to analyze the bunch of sentences whether they generally contains positive or negative emotions. The user can start the webserver by running app.py.
However, since I used flask and vader-sentiment open-source package, type this two command lines to install the package.

Installing Flask:

  pip install flask

Installing Vader-sentiment:

  pip install vader-sentiment



For the open-source packages, I used Flask to run the webserver.
